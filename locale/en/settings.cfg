[mod-setting-description]
stack-combinator-debug-mode=Debug mode enables verbose logging of actions that the mod performs. Log is printed to in-game console and to a file in `script-output` folder. Enable this if something is going wrong and you need more information about the inner workings of the mod.
stack-combinator-invert=Choose which input signals to invert (multiply by -1) by default when placing new combinators. See the mod's full description for more information on signal inversion.
stack-combinator-signal-capacity=Maximum number of signals that a stack combinator can output. Higher values may affect performance with large numbers of stack combinators in use (untested).
