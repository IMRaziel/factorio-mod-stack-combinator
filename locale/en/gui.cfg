invert=Invert input: [img=info]
invert-description=Choose which input signals to invert (multiply by -1). Can be used for tracking how "full" a container is of a certain item: invert the input and connect the container to the output. Stack combinator's negative signals will be subtracted from the container's positive, giving you a negative number that of how many items you're still missing. Can be then used conveniently with "X < 0" condition on belts, inserters and such to stop moving when the item amount has reached the number of stacks (and resume if it ever drops again).
invert-red=Red
invert-red-description=Invert all signals incoming on the red wire.
invert-green=Green
invert-green-description=Invert all signals incoming on the green wire.
